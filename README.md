A game of rolling dice. A Guided Project following the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) frontend developer career path. Extended the functionality by tracking the number of rolls it takes to win the game

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Roll until all dice are the same
- Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls
- See how many rolls it took to win the game
